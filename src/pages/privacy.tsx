<p><strong>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</em></strong></p>
<p><span ><strong><em>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analyze how our services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users</strong></li>

<li><strong>Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span ><strong><em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. To do so, please contact us at support@clicktok.xyz</strong></p>
<p><strong>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</strong></p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</strong></li>

<p><span ><strong>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</strong></span></p>
